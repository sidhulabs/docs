Once your Arcbeam deployment is running, you can begin monitoring your AI applications.

## First Login

When you log in for the first time, you'll see the onboarding page with setup instructions. Once you add your first data source, this screen will be replaced by the main Arcbeam homepage showing your projects, datasets, and observations.

1. [Set up your first integration](integrations) to connect to your data sources
2. [Send observations from your application](observations) to track usage
3. [Configure projects](projects) to organize and monitor your data
