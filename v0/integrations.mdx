# Setting Up Your First Integration

Integrations connect Arcbeam to your data sources so the platform can observe and track dataset usage.

## Adding an Integration

Follow these steps to set up your first integration:

1. From the left sidebar, click **Integrations**
2. Select your preferred data source type
3. Enter the required connection details:
   - **Connection string**: Must be in the format `postgresql://username:password@host:port/db`
   - **Collection/Index Name**: The table name of your embedding data
   - **Data source column**: The column or nested field that contains the raw document name
   - **Nested fields**: If any of the data are in nested fields, you can reference them using dot notation
4. Click **Save** to verify the connection

<Tip>
If your data sources are in a nested field in the metadata column called `source`, you can reference it as: `metadata.source`
</Tip>

## After Connection

Once connected, datasets from that source will appear in the **Datasets** view.

<Warning>
During the private beta, dataset integrations cannot be edited once they are created. Plan your configuration carefully before saving.
</Warning>

## Next Steps

After setting up your integration, you can:

- [Send observations from your application](observations) to start tracking usage
- [Configure projects](projects) to organize your monitoring
