# Setting Up Projects To Observe Your Data

When you first run Arcbeam, a default project is automatically created. You can connect your Postgres integration to this project right away, or create new projects to track specific LLM applications.

## What Are Projects?

Projects serve as the central place where you:

- Monitor application activity
- Apply policies to the data being used
- Track specific LLM applications

<Info>
You can use the default project immediately or create new ones to organize your monitoring by application, environment, or team.
</Info>

## Locate Your Project ID

To use a project in your application, you'll need its project ID:

1. Open the **Projects** page in the UI
2. Copy the ID from the **Default Project** card
3. Use this ID in your application when sending usage events to Arcbeam

## Next Steps

After setting up your projects:

- [Send observations from your application](observations) using the project ID
- Review application activity in the project dashboard
- Apply policies to enforce compliance and governance rules
- Iterate on policies and refine how your datasets are used
