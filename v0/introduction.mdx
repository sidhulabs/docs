## What You Can Do With Arcbeam

With Arcbeam, you can:

- **Observe data at the ingestion layer** and gain real-time visibility into source data usage down to the chunk level
- **Monitor LLM observations** by tracking queries, retrieved chunks, and responses across environments

## Platform Features

The platform integrates with vector databases like pgvector, and provides a web interface for visualization, management, and analysis.
