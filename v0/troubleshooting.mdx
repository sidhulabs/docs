# Troubleshooting

This page covers common issues, known limitations during the private beta, and frequently asked questions.

## Private Beta Known Issues

During the private beta, you may notice some limitations in usage, integrations, and the user interface. These will be addressed in future releases.

### Usage

- **Increased latency**: Applications may experience increased latency because data enrichment is performed inline rather than in the background

### Integrations

- **Cannot edit integrations**: Dataset integrations cannot be edited once they are created
- **No UI updates**: Unable to update integration details via the UI after creation

### User Interface

- **Date display inconsistencies**: Dates that are not provided may display inconsistently, sometimes appearing as "Just Now" or "Unknown"

<Warning>
Plan your integration configuration carefully before saving, as you cannot edit it afterward during the private beta.
</Warning>

## FAQ

### Failed to save integration. Please try again.

If you are getting this error, the `ORIGIN` environment variable is most likely not set up correctly on the web service component.

**Solution**: The `ORIGIN` variable should be set to the URL + port (if necessary) you see in the browser when using the platform.

**Examples**:

- If you are accessing the platform on your browser through `http://localhost:3000`, then `ORIGIN` should be set to `http://localhost:3000`
- If you are accessing the platform on your browser through `https://arcbeam.ai`, then `ORIGIN` should be set to `https://arcbeam.ai`

<Tip>
Make sure the `ORIGIN` environment variable in your `docker-compose.yml` matches the URL you use to access Arcbeam in your browser.
